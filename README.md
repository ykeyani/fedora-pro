# fedora-pro

Installs some themes and icon packs and a couple common applications.

```
# run the installer 1st pass
./fedora-pro.sh
# logout
# run the second pass, you don't need to reinstall git/applications
./fedora-pro.sh
# some configurations require a new login before they can be changed (easily).
```
